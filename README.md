# Edge Bundling for Parallel Coordinates

This repository contains the results of the university seminar project *"Visualization of Multidimensional Data"* completed during the Winter Term 2024/25 at the University of Stuttgart. As part of the seminar, each student was assigned a topic and two initial academic papers. Based on these, I conducted additional independent research, identified further relevant literature, and wrote a summary paper that consolidates, compares and extends the key concepts.
The focus of my work is on edge bundling techniques for Parallel Coordinate Plots (PCPs) - a method used to reduce visual clutter in the visualization of complex and high-dimensional datasets. The paper offers a structured overview of common edge bundling approaches, discusses their strengths, and limitations and introduces a taxonomy to distinguish between traditional data-centric and emerging techniques.
